Thank you for reporting a bug with the Scala compiler or standard library. We're sorry for the trouble it caused!

Some reporting guidelines that help us fix your bug faster:
  - provide a brief yet actionable description, such as "I tried [code snippet], the compiler said [error]. I think this should compile because [it used to work on older version X]."
  - include the Scala version(s) you tried, and the version of the JVM you're using
  - make sure it's a new bug :smirk:

This is the right place to report a bug in the compiler or the standard library.
For language design discussions, please consult the [README](README.md) for better venues. 

On this tracker, we care especially about: 
  - regressions
  - unintuitive error messages or unclear documentation
  - programs that [should | should not] compile but [do not| do]

Bug reports with a small, self-contained code snippet tend to get fixed faster.
Of course reports without a small reproduction are accepted too -- we know minimizing a bug can be tricky.
