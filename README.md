When [reporting a bug](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/new) with the Scala compiler and standard library, please:
  - do a quick search to make sure it's a new bug;
  - use a small, self-contained snippet of Scala code to illustrate what happened, and contrast with what you expected the compiler to say or the library to do;
  - include the Scala version(s) you've tried, and the version of the JVM you're using.
